<h1>The Best Anime Show According to Marcus</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Shows of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>
  It was one of my first Eastern style animation and it's been airing for over
  20 years.
</p>

<h3>HunterXHunter</h3>
<p>This is a show about fishing. HEHE</p>

<h3>Moonlight Fantasy</h3>
<p>
  This is a new gen anime but it has capivated me since the beginning. 10 out of
  10 would recommend
</p>

<h3>Jujutse Kaisen</h3>
<p>
  I love the unpredictable of this show and the thrill it provides for each
  episode. Just need to work on a few things like animation.
</p>

<h3>Mob Psycho 100</h3>
<p>
  This anime deserves to be appreciated more than what was given. The storyline,
  animation, character, development, and ending is perfect in my opinion.
